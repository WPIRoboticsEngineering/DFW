# WPI-RBE-DFW
This library was developed for use in the WPI robotics curriculum by Joseph St. Germain. It uses a DFRobots wireless arduino playstation style controller along with a pair of Xbee modules to connect your Arduino micro-controller to the PlayStaion style controller. Designed for use with Arduino mega, or any arduino with 2 serial ports. Currently only supports "Serial1".  Can be modified to use "Serial".

For Use simply search the arduino library manager for the "DFW" library.

The examples will then be avaible under File>examples>DFW>example1


This library includes a basic test program using serial.
A tank steer program for a servo driven robot.
A defualt sketch for the DF wireless controller
and Template code fore RBE1001.
