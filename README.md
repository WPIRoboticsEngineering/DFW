# WPI-RBE-DFW
This library was developed for use in the WPI robotics curriculum by Joseph St. Germain. It uses a DFRobots wireless arduino playstation style controller along with a pair of Xbee modules to connect your Arduino micro-controller to the PlayStaion style controller. Designed for use with Arduino mega, or any arduino with 2 serial ports. Currently only supports "Serial1".  Can be modified to use "Serial".

For Use simply copy the "DFW" folder into your arduino sketch-book or add it into the arduino/libraries folder.
Ex. "c:/program_files/Arduino/libraries/dfw

The examples will then be avaible under File>examples>DFW>example1


This library includes a basic test program using serial.
A tank steer program for a servo driven robot.
A defualt sketch for the DF wireless controller
and Template code fore RBE1001.
